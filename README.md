# A Data-Driven Approach to Obesity Risk Assessment

Obesity is a critical public health issue with significant physical and mental health implications, including increased risks for heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and sleep apnea. Our goal is to predict obesity levels from a dataset containing various features such as age, gender, and responses to lifestyle-related questions. 

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle:
[Obesity Levels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Prediction Notebook

Open and execute the `Obesity_Predictions.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.
